		<p>Hi there, we are Chasing Trends! We are a group that lies in some purgatory between math rock, indie, and jazz fusion (still getting to that one). Our major influences include Delta Sleep, Rush, Hippo Campus, and Faze Wave. Chasing Trends exists based on the idea that American monoculture makes it really easy to be content with what we are given. There is so much out there, and we want you to find it! Catch us perform second at 8:45!</p>
